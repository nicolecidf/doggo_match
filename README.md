This project was done to brush up on React and hooks. 

usState is used in all function components that have a state. For exaple, youWin and setYouwin. 
Here the hook allows us to set a youWin state when the user wins a game. 

Moreover, there are 3 components: cards, header, and you win screen. 

All pictures used are in the assets folder under the public folder.
